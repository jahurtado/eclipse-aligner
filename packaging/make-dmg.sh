# Build leftovers that the bundle has no use for. `direct_url.json` is the
# worst of them: an editable install records where it was installed from, so it
# carries the absolute path of this checkout -- somebody's home directory,
# shipped in every DMG. The uv files are build timestamps. METADATA stays,
# because `cli.identity()` reads the author and the homepage out of it at
# runtime, and so does the About box.
# The licences, inside the bundle. Nothing GPL travels in here -- Qt and LibRaw
# are LGPL and the rest is BSD or MIT -- but the LGPL asks for its notice just
# as plainly, and a notice that only exists in a source repository is not next
# to the thing it describes.

===============

Drag the app onto the Applications folder beside it.

The first time you open it, macOS will say it cannot be opened because
Apple cannot check it for malicious software. That is expected: this app
is not signed with an Apple Developer ID, which costs 99 USD a year.

To open it anyway, either

  * open  System Settings -> Privacy & Security,  scroll to the bottom,
    and press "Open Anyway" next to the message about eclipse-aligner.
    Then open the app again and confirm. Once is enough, for ever.

or, if you prefer the one line,

    xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/eclipse-aligner.app

Control-clicking the icon and choosing Open used to work; Apple removed
that shortcut in macOS 15.

Apple Silicon only. On an Intel Mac, install from source instead:

# The checksum, beside the file and in the format `shasum -c` reads back, so
# whoever downloads it can check it with one command and no arguments. Written
# by the build rather than typed at release time: a hash worked out later is a
# hash of whatever happened to be in dist/.
