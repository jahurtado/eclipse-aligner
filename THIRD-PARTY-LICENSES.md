# Third-party software in the desktop builds

Running from source, this program is the code in `src/` and nothing else: uv
fetches the libraries and their licences come with them.

The **desktop builds are different**. The macOS `.app` and the Windows folder
carry their own Python and their own Qt, so what you download is one file
containing work by a lot of other people under their own terms. This is the
list, and it is shipped inside the builds as well —
`Contents/Resources/licenses/` on macOS, `licenses\` on Windows — because a
notice that only exists in a source repository is not next to the thing it
describes.

**No GPL software is bundled here.** That is worth stating plainly, because the
sibling project `hdrmerge-timelapser` does bundle some and the two are often
installed together. This one carries LGPL libraries and permissive ones, and
nothing else; the GPL-3 on this program is a choice, not something inherited.

## eclipse-aligner itself

GPL-3.0-or-later. The full text is in [LICENSE](LICENSE), and the source is at
<https://github.com/jahurtado/eclipse-aligner>.

## Qt

**LGPL-3.0**, through PySide6 — the editor window, and nothing else in the
program. Qt is an unmodified upstream binary, used as a shared library and
dynamically linked, which is what the LGPL asks for. Relinking against a
different build of Qt means replacing the libraries inside the bundle; the
source is published at the address below.

- Qt: <https://www.qt.io/> — source at <https://download.qt.io/archive/qt/>
- PySide6 / shiboken6: LGPL-3.0-only, <https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_for_Python>

## LibRaw

**LGPL-2.1 or CDDL-1.0**, reached through `rawpy` (MIT). LibRaw is what reads
NEF, CR2 and CR3, and what develops a DNG to check the output against the
original. The wheel carries an unmodified build.

- rawpy: <https://github.com/letmaik/rawpy>

## Python

**PSF-2.0.** The builds carry their own interpreter — a framework build on
macOS, the embeddable distribution on Windows — so nothing has to be installed.

## The rest

Permissive, and none of them modified:

| package | licence |
|---|---|
| numpy | BSD-3-Clause (with 0BSD, MIT, Zlib and CC0-1.0 parts) |
| scipy | BSD-3-Clause |
| scikit-image | BSD-3-Clause |
| tifffile | BSD-3-Clause |
| imagecodecs | BSD-3-Clause |
| imageio | BSD-2-Clause |
| networkx | BSD-3-Clause |
| lazy-loader | BSD-3-Clause |
| packaging | Apache-2.0 or BSD-2-Clause |
| Pillow | MIT-CMU |

Pillow does more here than read a JPEG: it is what reads the EXIF that
`apply` copies into a shifted DNG, which is the job exiftool used to do.

PyInstaller (GPL-2.0 with its bootloader exception) and the Inno Setup compiler
build the packages and are not part of them.
