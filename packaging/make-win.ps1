# There is no frozen binary here, and that is the whole point. PyInstaller's
# bootloader trips a Windows Defender false positive (`Program:Win32/Vigram.A`)
# that silently truncates whatever carries it -- the compiled installer came out
# corrupt every time. An embeddable Python is just python.exe, its stdlib zip,
# and a folder of ordinary wheels; Defender has nothing to object to, so nothing
# gets eaten.
#
# The result is dist\eclipse-aligner\ (the payload the installer also takes) and
# dist\eclipse-aligner-VERSION-x64.zip. It carries its own Python and needs
# nothing on the machine. **Not signed** -- an unsigned download still trips
# SmartScreen the first time; the note inside the zip says so.
#
# x64 only, and the embeddable Python is pinned to the exact version of the venv
# doing the build, because the wheels pip resolves are for that ABI.

===============

This folder is the whole program. Nothing to install: run
eclipse-aligner.cmd to open the editor. Put the folder wherever you like --
Documents, the Desktop, a USB stick -- and make a shortcut to the .cmd if you
want it handy.

For the command line -- detect and apply -- call the interpreter inside:

    python\python.exe -m eclipse_aligner detect my-clip --method circle
    python\python.exe -m eclipse_aligner apply  my-clip

The first time you run it, Windows may say "Windows protected your PC" and
show a blue box. That is expected: this program is not signed with a
code-signing certificate, which is a yearly cost, so Windows does not
recognise the publisher. Click "More info", then "Run anyway". Once is enough.

It carries everything it needs. Nothing has to be installed beside it.
